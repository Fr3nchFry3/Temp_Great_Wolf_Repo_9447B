This is a temporary repository to house our notebook for the Anderson robotics Event.

Hi judges! Our notebook should be the only file in the repository other than the readme. Just click on it and you should see the notebook. Unfortunately, due to GitHub's formatting, if you would like to use the links in the table of contents, or view the videos, you will have to download the file, which is located on the right of your screen as soon as you click on the link.
